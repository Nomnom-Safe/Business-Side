## Requirements

1. User Testing

   1.1 As a **test organizer**, I want to contact 20+ independent food service businesses so that I can schedule sufficient testing sessions for round 1.

   1.2 As a **test organizer**, I want to recruit 10-15 app users (business owners/staff) for round 1 so that I can gather diverse feedback on the MVP.

   1.3 As a **researcher**, I want to conduct usability sessions and capture feedback via surveys and notes for round 1 so that I can identify key pain points and opportunities.

   1.4 As an **app user**, I want to test core MVP features like menu scanning, safety checks, and alerts during 30-45 minute sessions for round 1 so that real-world usability is validated.

   1.5 As a **developer**, I want to set up the test environment with demo data and logging for round 1 so that bugs are easily tracked and reproduced.

   1.6 As a **test organizer**, I want to coordinate round 2 participants, focusing on revised MVP areas, so that targeted feedback drives final refinements.

   1.7 As a **researcher**, I want to conduct usability sessions and capture feedback via surveys and notes for round 2 so that I can identify key pain points and opportunities.

   1.8 As an **app user**, I want to test core MVP features like menu scanning, safety checks, and alerts during 30-45 minute sessions for round 2 so that real-world usability is validated.

   1.9 As a **developer**, I want to set up the test environment with demo data and logging for round 2 so that bugs are easily tracked and reproduced.

2. MVP Revisions

   2.1 As a **developer**, I want to prioritize the top 5-10 feedback issues from round 1 so that quick fixes address the most critical problems first.

   2.2 As a **researcher**, I want to analyze feedback themes from round 1 and create a revision spec document so that development efforts are focused and documented.

   2.3 As a **developer**, I want to implement UI/UX changes, backend tweaks, and bug fixes within a 1-week sprint for round 1 so that iterations stay on schedule.

   2.4 As an **app user**, I want to validate revised features during round 2 testing sessions so that improvements are confirmed effective.

   2.5 As a **developer**, I want to implement UI/UX changes, backend tweaks, and bug fixes within a 1-week sprint for round 2 so that iterations stay on schedule.

   2.6 As a **developer**, I want to prioritize the top 5-10 feedback issues from round 2 so that quick fixes address the most critical problems first.

   2.7 As a **researcher**, I want to analyze feedback themes from round 2 and create a revision spec document so that development efforts are focused and documented.

   2.8 As a **developer**, I want to implement UI/UX changes, backend tweaks, and bug fixes within a 1-week sprint for round 2 so that iterations stay on schedule.

3. Presentation

   3.1 As a **researcher**, I want to draft a slide deck with project background, app features, testing results, and outcomes so that the presentation tells a compelling story.

   3.2 As a **developer**, I want to prepare a live demo video or screenshots of the final app so that the audience sees it in action.

   3.3 As a **researcher**, I want to rehearse a 10-15 minute presentation with user quotes and metrics so that delivery is polished and persuasive.

   3.4 As a **test organizer**, I want to compile testing summary stats (e.g., participants, satisfaction scores) for visuals so that results are easy to digest.

   3.5 As a **developer**, I want to ensure the app is polished and demo-ready for the event so that there are no technical issues during the presentation.
