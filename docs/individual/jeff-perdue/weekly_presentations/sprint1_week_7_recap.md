# Week 7 Focus: Improved Business Onboarding

### Goal

Make it **clear and easy** for new business users to complete their profile.

### Context

- PPP Feature 4 – **Improved Business Onboarding**  
- Builds on Weeks 1–6 MVP foundation  
- Structured flow, validation, and optional prefill  

---

# Structured Onboarding Flow

### What Was Added

- **Two-step flow:** Step 1 – Business info; Step 2 – Allergens & diets  
- **Progress labels** so users know where they are  
- **Single submit** at the end — no placeholder business or confusing steps  
- **Data persists** when moving back and forth between steps  

---

# Manual Entry & Optional Prefill

### Manual Entry

- Required fields clearly indicated  
- Validation before completion — users know what to fix  
- Address fields grouped for clarity  

### Optional Prefill

- **"Find your business"** search uses Google Places  
- Selecting a result prefills name, website, and address  
- Users can review and edit any prefilled data  

---

# Guided Tour & Sign-Up Improvements

### Onboarding Tour

- First-time users see a **guided tour** highlighting key areas  
- Tour runs once per new user  
- Helps users understand the flow before they start  

### Sign-Up

- **Password rules** shown clearly (length, uppercase, lowercase, number)  
- Specific error messages instead of generic "Sign up failed"  
- Form data preserved when validation fails  

---

# Edit Business Information

### What Changed

- **Allergens and diets** are now editable (same as onboarding)  
- Removed logo upload and Business Disclaimer for MVP  
- Section-based layout: Basic Info, Address, Allergens, Dietary Options  
- Cleaner, more modern layout  

---

# Outcomes vs Sprint 1 Plan

- Feature 4 – **Improved Business Onboarding** completed  
- Structured flow with clear required fields and validation  
- Optional Google Places prefill with review and edit
