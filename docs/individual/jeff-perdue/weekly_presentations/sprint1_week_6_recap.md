# Week 6 Focus: Item Discovery & Menu Editing

### Goal

Improve how business users **find and manage** menu items and menus.

### Context

- Builds on Week 5 front-end refactor  
- PPP Feature 3 – **Expanded Search, Filter, and Sort**  
- New UI/UX for editing menus and menu items  

---

# Enhanced Search, Sort, and Filter

### What Was Added

- **Search** menu items by name  
- **Filter** by menu or by allergen (items that contain or do not contain selected allergens)  
- **Sort** options for item lists  
- Search, filter, and sort work **together** so users can refine results without losing their choices  

---
### Why It Matters

- Faster item lookup  
- Less friction when reviewing or updating allergen-related data  
- Predictable, controllable discovery  

---

# New UI/UX for Editing Menus and Menu Items

### What Changed

- Clearer flows for **editing menus** and **menu items**  
- Easier to see what you’re editing and where you are in the flow  
- More consistent layout and controls  

### Outcome

- Better control over menu and item data  
- Fewer errors and less confusion during updates

# Outcomes vs Sprint 1 Plan

### Week 6 Deliverables

- Feature 3 – **Expanded Search, Filter, and Sort** completed  
- Item discovery improved (search, filter, sort in place)  
- Menu and menu-item editing experience updated for clarity and ease of use  

This completes the Week 6 milestone and sets up **Week 7: Improved Business Onboarding**.
